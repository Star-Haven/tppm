# TPPM Website #

### Installation ###

Setting up the dev environment is easy. Clone the Repo with git and run `npm install`. You must have Node installed on your machine.

### Setting up Environments ###

When you are ready to set up the server (running on port 3000), run `npm run dev` as any changes done on a file will *NOT* require a restart of the app in the terminal. When you are ready for production, run `npm run production`. These are the two methods of running the app.
